1. Docker installation instructions: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce
2. Docker-compose installation instructions: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#alternative-install-options

Then create a Docker image. To do this, enter the command:
```
    $ make build
```

Step 2 - set up a log folder and file
--------------------------
- create a log file in the root project if this has not been created - "cron/cron.log"
- ensure you set the path in the log settings tot he cron log file
```
    'handlers': {
        'cron_file': {
            'level': 'INFO',
            'class': 'logging.FileHandler',
            'filename': BASE_DIR/'cron/cron.log',  # Replace with the desired path to your log file
        },
    },

```

Step 3 - change the celery settings

Go to the ```backend/settings.py``` and change as seen:
```
    CELERY_BROKER_URL = "redis://rd-sqlite:6379"
    CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = "redis://rd-sqlite:6379"
```

Step 4 - run the app
-------------------------
launch the container
```
    $ docker-compose up --build
```

Step 5 - go to the localhost port on your browser
-------------------------
```localport:8000```


# Another way to run the app, through virtual env

1. Create a virtual environment
```
    $ virtualenv venv -p /usr/bin/python3 --no-site-package
```
2. Activate virtual environment
```
    $ source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Establish requirements
```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Create a log file in a directory in the root project
5. Run migrations
```
    $ python manage.py makemigrations
```
6. Run migrate
```
    $ python manage.py migrate
```
7. Create superuser
```
    $ python manage.py createsuperuser
```
8. Run server
```
    $ python manage.py runserver
```
